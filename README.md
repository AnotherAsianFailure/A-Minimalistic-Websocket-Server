# A-Minimalistic-Websocket-Server
A work-in-progress software of an absent-minded idiot, written entirely in C, with occasional instances of plagiarizing code and use of open-source libraries.

## Compiling From Source (Linux):
(You have no other choice)

1. Download/Clone this Repository onto your local machine (or piece of metal).
2. Change Directory (cd) into the root of this repository.
3. Run `gcc -o wsserver sha1.c base64.c wsserver.c`  (I know, I know, this is not the proper way to do it)
4. Now you should have a dynamicaly-linked Linux executable file named **"wsserver"**.
5. Have fun running it! (`./wsserver`)
